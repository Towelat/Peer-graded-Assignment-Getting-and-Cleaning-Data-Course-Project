#  Describing the variables and data

The data was presented in a zip file that contained data on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset from Samsung.
The data included test data, training data, activity labels, feauters, feature information and a ReadMe file all in a txt format.

# Work performed to clean up the data
Work was done by following these steps:

    .Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    .Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    .Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    .Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    .From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Process involved reading in the data, combining it into two separate data sets called "test" and "train", combining these two data sets, then 
extracting the required information in a variable called "wanted" and then finally making the last table and averaging the specified data.
