# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project was to test my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set that can be used for later analysis.
The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and consisted of test and train datasets. This data came with a list of activity labels and feature desciptions to help interpret the data shown. 
The goal of this project was to :
    Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
    create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    All the steps mentioned above are completed with annotated code to help.
